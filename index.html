          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan. I served in Iraq with 4th Infantry Division and in Afghanistan with the 101st Airborne Division.
            As a veteran, I have a deep understanding of the challenges of war and the importance of teamwork and leadership. After the Army, I tried my hand at many things.
            Nothing stuck, that is, until I tried my hand at welding in 2019. Since then, I have wanted to change my career field and pursue a career in tech.

      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>Network Monitors</h3>
        <p>One is an HTML local file that uses OpenSpeedTest API to monitor network speed and latency. It also auto-refreshes every 5 minutes. It's built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
          Another is a basic HTML file that just checks your internet connection every 15 seconds. It displays you IP, ISP, location, and hostname.
          A third HTML file that displays things a little more visually appealing. This one does not auto-refresh, but it does display your IP, ISP, location, hostname, and was a test for the OpenSpeedTest API.
          These will remain unpublished, as they are for personal use.</p>

  <h3>Idle RPG Evolution ‚Äì From Python to JavaScript</h3>
  <p>Originally started as <a href="https://github.com/XnosmirC/IdleTextGame" target="_blank">IdleTextGame</a>, a Python-based idle experience with text-only mechanics and modular upgrades.

  <p>Development highlights:
    <ul>
      <li>Refactored core logic from procedural Python to modular JavaScript systems</li>
      <li>Introduced layered pixel sprites and boss animation cycles for visual feedback</li>
      <li>UI rebuilt from scratch for browser-based playability and intuitive control</li>
    </ul>
